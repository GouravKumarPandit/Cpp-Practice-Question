Template is blue print of class.When we create template, we tell the compiler that we will tell the data type of a variavle 
later.Template is place holder of some data type.When we need to make a function or class of diffrent - different data type, 
than we create template,because it is better to create template instead of making more function, class of differnt-different
data type.We have to declare template before the defining the every funtion.

Syntax of template :-
template <class place-holder>
return type  name of the function (place-holder  variable name){
    and some code;
}

There is a two type of Template --> 1)Function template 2) Class template
